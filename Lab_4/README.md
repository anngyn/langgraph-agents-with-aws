# Lab 4: Persistence and Streaming

Welcome to this section, where we will explore two critical concepts emerging in the development of sophisticated AI agents, particularly those designed for extended operations: persistence and streaming. These concepts are fundamental to creating robust, responsive, and scalable AI solutions.

Persistence enables the preservation of an agent's state at specific points in time, facilitating seamless resumption of operations in subsequent interactions. This capability is particularly crucial for long-running applications where continuity is paramount. Streaming, on the other hand, provides real-time visibility into the agent's operations, emitting a series of signals that indicate the agent's current actions and thought processes. This feature is invaluable for monitoring and understanding the behavior of long-running applications.

In this section, we will explore these concepts in depth utilizing Anthropic's Claude model on Amazon Bedrock as our foundation.
