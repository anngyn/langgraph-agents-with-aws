# Lab 5: Human in the Loop

Welcome to this advanced section on implementing human-in-the-loop interactions with AI agents using LangGraph, Anthropic's Claude model on Amazon Bedrock. 
This section is designed for solution architects and data scientists looking to build sophisticated AI systems with human oversight capabilities.

Before we dive into the code, let's understand the big picture. Imagine you're architecting a mission-critical AI system for a large enterprise. This system needs to make complex decisions, but also requires human oversight for accountability and error correction. This is where human-in-the-loop AI comes in.

Think of our system as a collaborative decision-making pipeline between AI and human experts. LangGraph provides the framework for this pipeline, the foundation models on Amazon Bedrock bring the AI capabilities, which also brings the scalable cloud infrastructure.

Let's dive in!
